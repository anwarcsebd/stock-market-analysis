# Stock Market Data Analysis
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is the project related to Exploratory data analysis(
EDA), Data visualization and Predictive analysis using data, provided by The Investors Exchange (IEX). I looked at real-time financial data from the stock market. I have used **Python** programming language to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. I have also used statistical method called Monte Carlo Method to predict future stock prices.
